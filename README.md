# Simulating a Ticketing System 

## Objective

This project simulates a ticketing system using Zammad to demonstrate security hardening techniques and troubleshooting processes found in a real-world IT environment. By configuring and securing the platform, the project highlights best practices for access control, incident response, and system resilience. It serves as a showcase of hands-on cybersecurity skills, emphasizing the ability to identify, mitigate, and resolve security vulnerabilities within a service management system.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- VMWware Workstation Player
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
- Create and Prepare an Ubuntu Server LTS Environment:

After downloading Ubuntu from a reliable and secure source. Input the image file into VMWare and launch the software. Configure Ubuntu as needed.

- Installing Docker with necessary dependencies:
 Docker simplifies the setup process and helps prevent conflicts with existing system packages, particularly when setting up complex environments. It can containerize services such as PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Ruby, Node.js, and Redis, allowing them to run independently but interact with each other as needed.
